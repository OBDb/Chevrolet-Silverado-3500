generations:
  - name: "First Generation (GMT800)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Silverado 3500 (HD from 2001) represented Chevrolet's one-ton pickup truck, replacing the C/K 3500 series. Available in single rear wheel (SRW) or dual rear wheel (DRW) configurations, it offered maximum capability in the Silverado lineup. Powertrain options mirrored the 2500 with a standard 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine and the optional 6.6L Duramax diesel V8 paired with an Allison transmission. The 3500 featured the heaviest-duty components, including a strengthened frame, commercial-grade suspension, and enhanced cooling systems. Available in regular cab, extended cab, and crew cab configurations with various bed options including a chassis cab for aftermarket upfitting, it served both commercial and personal customers needing maximum hauling and towing capability. This generation established the Silverado 3500HD as a capable work truck that could also serve as personal transportation."

    description: "The redesigned Silverado 3500HD shared its major architectural elements with the 2500HD but included upgraded components to achieve higher payload and towing ratings. The 6.0L gasoline V8 continued as the standard engine, while the 6.6L Duramax diesel received significant updates throughout this generation, eventually reaching 397 HP and 765 lb-ft of torque. Interior comfort and features improved substantially over the previous generation, making these heavy-duty trucks more suitable for dual-purpose use. Capability increased with class-competitive towing and payload ratings, while features like an integrated trailer brake controller and exhaust brake improved towing safety. The DRW models offered maximum capability for fifth-wheel and gooseneck towing applications, while SRW variants balanced capability with everyday usability."

The interior offered improved technology including the Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system. Heavy-duty-specific features expanded to include Digital Steering Assist, enhanced cooling packages, and integrated bumper steps for easier bed access. Maximum towing capacity exceeded 23,000 pounds for properly equipped models, maintaining competitiveness in the one-ton segment. High-end trim levels like the High Country brought near-luxury appointments to these work-capable trucks, reflecting their increasing use as both work and personal vehicles."
